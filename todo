1. Clean up code before adding more or else the code will become messier than it already is and making
changes/updates will become more tedious. -> Done 11/10/23

2. Use the spotify API to search the tracks in the album chosen at the bottom of the albums.html file.
-> Done 11/10/23

3. Make it such that when the user searches another artist from the albums.html page the renderer switches
back to the index.html page. -> Done 11/10/23

4. Improve perfomance by reducing the amount of on demand API requests by making them sooner and storing the data in a cache. -> Done 11/11/23

5. Improve Artist html page UI

6. Integrate the RFID scanner and find a way to write the album URI to the chip instead of a sql database

7. Add a homepage where the albums that are already scanned by the user and associated with RFID chips are presented, this data is stored in the SQL database 
    and the homepage should be updated whenever the user clicks to view it.

    Plan:
        Homepage should be:
            grid style, 3x3 with the albums taking up the majority of the space
            a search bar atop with artist search feature
            album image paths should be stored in the SQL database and are retrieved for display
